# Iterator

## Tl;dr

An old radio set will be a good example of iterator, where user could start at some channel and then use next or previous buttons to go through the respective channels. Or take an example of MP3 player or a TV set where you could press the next and previous buttons to go through the consecutive channels or in other words they all provide an interface to iterate through the respective channels, songs or radio stations.

Ruby has the module Enumerable for this : http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Enumerable.html
